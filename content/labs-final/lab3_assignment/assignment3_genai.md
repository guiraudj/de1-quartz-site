I used AI to help me:

- Identify and fix Python errors in my shuffle and hash join implementations.

- Understand the differences between shuffle joins and replicated hash joins, and decide when each is preferable based on input sizes and key distributions.

- Validate outputs by comparing results from both join methods and ensuring they matched expectations.

- Debugging my Python code, especially fixing errors with tuples and strings in RDDs.
